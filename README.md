## My process

### Built with

-   SASS preprocessor
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Ipify and Google Maps as third party services
-   [Vue2](https://vuejs.org/) - Vue 2

### What I learned

This was my first challenge in Vue 2, with this challenge a learn the basis about this cool framework! :blush:.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

### Continued development

Vue 2 is a pretty cool framework but nowdays Vue 3 with composotion API is the tend. What's more cool is the use of typescript which is one my favourites
languanges because i use to developt some app in Angular combined with NestJS.

### Useful resources

-   [Vue 2 doc](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) - This is the Vue guide, it's a high quality doc, so i guess that's all you need.

## Acknowledgments

Well, i made this challenge twices: once with Angular and another with Vue.

I decided to repeat this project with Vue because i think is one of the best projects to practice any tool of your convinience. In my case, i decided to do it with this tool and remove the Angular version cuz it didn't make any sense to develop an easy app with something that you use everyday. Cuz you know, that would't really be a challenge...

And why do i think this is the perfect project to practice with something new? Because if you got some global knowlendge about web development, in this challenge you'll find a cool app with a simply design and all the services from third parties. Something to practice with a really cool functionallity which you make blow your friends mind out!
